# Limbic-Flow
An experimental cognitive architecture treating LLMs as an abstraction layer. By integrating mathematical emotion models (PAD) with noise-injected RAG middleware, this framework simulates human emotional decay, memory distortion, and pathological states (e.g., Alzheimer's, PTSD) within a vector database environment.
